### Isogenies

#### Definition

[{{#cite Was08}}, Chapter XII.1] Let \\(E_1:y^2=x^3+a_1x+b_1\\) and \\(E_2:y^2=x^3+a_2x+b_2\\) be elliptic curves over a field \\(K\\). An **isogeny** from \\(E_1\\) to \\(E_2\\) is a nonconstant homorphism \\(\alpha:E_1 \rightarrow E_2\\) that is given by rational functions such that \\(\alpha(O)=O\\). 

This means \\(\alpha(P+Q)=\alpha(P)+\alpha(Q)\\) for all \\(P,Q \in E_1\\) and there exists rational functions \\(P, Q\\) such that if \\(\alpha(x_1, y_1)=(P(x_1, y_1),Q(x_1, y_1))\\).

In fact, it can be proved that we can write \\(\alpha\\) in the form \\(\alpha(x_1, y_1)=(p(x_1), y_1q(x_1))\\).

If \\(p(x)=\dfrac{r(x)}{s(x)}\\) for polynomials 
\\(r\\) and \\(s\\) without common roots, define the degree of \\(\alpha\\) to be \\(Max(deg(r(x)),deg(s(x)))\\). 

We say an isogeny is **seperable** if \\(s(x)\\) have no repeated roots.

#### Example

Consider two curves \\(E_1:y^2=x^3+x\\) and \\(E_2:y^2=x^3-4x\\) over \\(\mathbb{F}_{11}\\). Then the map
$$\alpha: E_1 \rightarrow E_2$$
$$(x,y) \mapsto \left(\dfrac{x^2+1}{x},\dfrac{y(x^2-1)}{x}\right)$$
is an isogeny from \\(E_1\\) to \\(E_2\\).

#### Properties

We mention several important properties of isogenies.

1. Isogenies are uniquely determined by their kernel: Given an elliptic curve \\(E\\) and a subgroup \\(L\\), there is an unique elliptic curve \\(E'\\) and an isogeny \\(\alpha: E \rightarrow E'\\) such that the kernel of \\(\alpha\\) is \\(L\\).

1. [{{#cite Sil09}}, Chapter III.6, Theorem 6.2] For every isogeny \\(\alpha: E \rightarrow E'\\) of degree \\(l\\), there exists an unique dual isogeny \\(\hat{\alpha}: E' \rightarrow E\\) such that \\(\alpha \hat{\alpha}= \hat{\alpha} \alpha=l\\)

1. [{{#cite Gha21}}, Proposition 2.2] (**Decomposition of isogenies**)  Let \\(\alpha: E \rightarrow E'\\) be a seperable isogeny. Then there exists an integer \\(k\\) elliptic curves \\(E=E_0, E_1,...,E_n=E'\\) and isogenies \\(\beta_i: E_i \rightarrow E_{i+1}\\) of prime degree such that \\(\alpha=\beta_{n-1} \beta_{n-2} ... \beta_{0} [k]\\)

The edges of Supersingular isogeny graphs are determined by isogenies between the curves, we will talk about it later in the definition of the graph.
