## Orand: Public Randomness Beacon

**Orand** leverages a **Distributed Verifiable Random Function (DVRF)**. In this setup, multiple participants collaborate in a distributed computational process to generate a single random value. Each participant contributes to the computation, but no individual can determine the outcome alone. This collective approach ensures that the resultant random value is both unpredictable and unbiased. Importantly, the generated value can be verified by anyone, maintaining transparency and eliminating the need for trust in any single third party, as the randomness's integrity is collectively assured and publicly verifiable.

## Orocle: zkOracle Service

**Orocle** is a oracle service that fetches and verifies off-chain data to be used within blockchain smart contracts. Unlike traditional centralized oracles, Orocle operates on a provable model, reducing the risks associated with single points of failure and enhancing trust through a distributed network of nodes. This service is crafted to provide real-time, accurate data feeds for dynamic applications in the Web3 ecosystem.
