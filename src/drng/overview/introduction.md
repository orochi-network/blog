# Introduction
Randomness plays an important role in many modern aspects such as simulation, statistical
studying, game analysis, cryptography. Because randomness are needed in so many aspects,
generating a reliable source of randomness has been a problem for ages. However, generating
randomness has proven to be a difficult challenge. Many methods generate values that are
easily predictable or too costly for practical usage.

Nowaday, blockchain is considered as a potential technology that can change the world.
It has a lot of usecases in most of fields thanks to many essential properties such as publicity,
transparency and equity. Thus, a number of traditional applications which need its properties
tend to be moved on top of this technology. However, due to publicity and determinism,
blockchain canâ€™t generate a secure random number itsel
